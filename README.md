# path_finder
Graph traversing (world map from board game "Arkham Horror LCG", campaign "Scarlet Keys"). 
Every location is assigned some "value" when you visit it.
Every path between 2 directly linked locations cost "1 time" as well as one location visiting.
You can also not to stop at the location - in such a case you will not pay "1 time" for visiting, you will pay time only for travelling. 
Task: find path to maximize total earned value in a limited time.
